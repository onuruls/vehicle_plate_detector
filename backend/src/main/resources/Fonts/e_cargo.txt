Hi, here's a short guide how to use the font.
To generate the number plate-effect, use the following glyphs:
( start number plate
) end of number plate
µ space
all letters are spelled in lower case
° 0 (zero)
^ 1
\ 2
§ 3
$ 4
% 5
& 6
/ 7
[ 8
] 9
. <
- >
_ }
+ *
? ~
! #
@ ;
, ³
: ²

If you like my font, I'm asking you to
put a link to my page www.anke-art.de on YOUR page. On my homepage you can find a little
logo in the upper left corner which you can copy as a link.
If you don't want to link to my page, but still want to use my font(s) nevertheless,
please send any amount in US-Dollars (which you think the font is worth) to:
Anke Arnold
Fabrikstrasse 62
73240 Wendlingen
Germany

Thank you sooo much!
